## 1. Summary

Independent tabs retain Flagged Domains/Sample04 DNS detail and Flagged DNS records/exact record detail. Both filtered list states preserve search/sort/flag/page through fresh saved URLs and list/detail returns. Fresh saved URLs restore all four journeys, and two exact list/detail round trips preserve context. Invalid filtered URLs clear only affected rows; healthy main inventory remains retained and explicit repair works. Full95/95 tests pass, lint96, schema22+2/114FK unchanged and buildPASS. DONE is limited to assigned synthetic/local scope.

## 2. Acceptance criteria







Original AC and V4–V6 rows below retain their previously accepted scope. V7 replaces the historical candidate-search implementation with an explicitly assigned API.

| ID | Criterion | Result / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | Complete paginated records with provenance | Previously accepted v2 mockHTTP/PostgreSQL evidence:7 records across2 synthetic zones. V4 lists stored Domain/DNS fields and provenance; full regression passes; no live claim. |
| AC-2 | Idempotent sync preserves first_seen, advances last_seen | Previously accepted7->7/0created/7updated v2proof retained; existing full regression green. V4 read-only endpoints do not sync or alter rows. |
| AC-3 | Strict read-only Cloudflare paths/tests | Pass: accepted34GET-only mock calls retained; existing transport/source audit regression green. V4 reader imports no Cloudflare client and calls none; database integration reads inside BEGIN READ ONLY. |

## 3. Work completed

Independent tabs retain Flagged Domains/Sample04 DNS detail and Flagged DNS records/exact record detail. Both filtered list states preserve search/sort/flag/page through fresh saved URLs and list/detail returns. Added exactly three tests in the existing file and one isolated synthetic fixture option. Reused accepted GET APIs, schema and Atlas styling. Actual built-in browser verifies independent filtered tabs, all four fresh saved routes, two exact list/detail round trips, native history, all four invalid filters and explicit repairs. One START18:27 (comment 1100390000161633) published before implementation; no new START on resume. No task status, description or dependency changed; the18:27 task activity was the START comment only.

## 4. Files changed

| File | Specific change |
|---|---|
| frontend/src/host-navigation.mjs | Serialize host_origin=unassigned and unassigned_saved when selecting an Unassigned Host. Detail Back restores that filtered list and its saved search/sort/page; Site origin remains separate. |
| frontend/test/view-bookmarks.test.mjs | Exactly three new tests: paired filtered-tab isolation; fresh saved URLs with two exact list/detail trips for all four journeys; invalid-filter isolation/repair and fresh defaults after close. Opt-in mixed fixture only for v31 tests. |
| scripts/inventory-ui-lab.mjs | Add isolated --filtered-tabs fixture: synthetic Host13..24 unassigned, Host1..12 assigned; old fixtures unchanged. |
| Docs/HOST-INVENTORY-UI.md | Document filtered Host origin, mixed fixture and full reproduction flow. |
| Docs/DOMAIN-INVENTORY-UI.md | Document independent Flagged Domain versus Flagged record journeys and test scope. |
| Docs/evidence/S0-004/verification-v31.json | Record exact checks, per-criterion proof, actual browser observations and resolved interruption. |
| Docs/evidence/S0-004/{test,lint,build}-v31.txt | Actual full-suite95pass,lint96/schema22+2/114FK and build output. |
| Docs/evidence/S0-004/domain-filtered-{reload,history,invalid}-v31.png | Three real settled built-in browser screenshots covering filtered detail reload/history and invalid filter. |
| Docs/RESULT-TASK-S0-004.md | Canonical ten-section v31 report; preserve original/history and separate V31 rows. |

## 5. Run and verify

Repository root: `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`.
Focused: `node --test --test-concurrency=1 frontend/test/view-bookmarks.test.mjs` (12 tests, exactly3 newv31).
Browser lab: `node scripts/inventory-ui-lab.mjs --host-detail --sites --site-journey --filtered-tabs --detail-dns --flagged`.
Use filtered31.site/unassigned/flagged/records from the test. In two independent tabs open Site Host11 and Unassigned Host20; Back/reopen twice and compare complete canonical detail URLs. Repeat with Flagged Domains/Sample04 DNS and Flagged DNS records/first page2 record. Save each complete detail URL, independently create a fresh tab, restore and repeat two trips. Set the corresponding site_sort/unassigned_sort/flagged_sort/record_sort to bad in a fresh list URL, verify zero affected rows and retained healthy main rows, then explicitly restore the valid URL. Close and open a new default tab. Fixture setup precedes BEGIN READ ONLY.

## 6. Tests and actual results

Full95/95 passed,0failed;12 targeted passed;exactly3new tests in existing view-bookmarks.test.mjs. Lint96modules;schema22entities+2junctions/114nativeFK unchanged;buildPASS. V31_FILTERED_TABS proves both independent pairs and2trips;V31_FRESH_FILTER proves0initial entries/fullsavedURL/2exacttrips for all4journeys;V31_INVALID_FILTER proves all4 errors,0affectedrows,healthy main rows and repair. Actual HTTP/PostgreSQL17.5WASM runs inside READ ONLY after synthetic setup. Actual browser independently verifies all four routes and captures three settled screenshots per task. Cloudflare requests0.

## 7. Issues and implementation decisions

Fixed the observed Unassigned Host selection path, which previously serialized the Site origin. Explicit Unassigned origin and saved fields now survive every detail change and Back. Mixed assigned/unassigned lab data is a separate opt-in fixture so older acceptance evidence is unchanged. Integration tab stores are models; real independent browser tabs separately supply UI evidence. Automatic approval review initially rejected loopback browser access because of a usage limit; no bypass or alternate browser was used. Resumed through the same normal browser after the reported reset, reopened exact assigned task tabs after app reset, and reread live instructions. Lead19:33 consolidation comments1100390000161726/1727 were explicitly withdrawn19:34 due incomplete comment-window reading; original18:11 filtered-feature assignment remains the only effective v31 assignment. Thus no consolidation scope change was applied. No targeted/full test failures. Python console encoding issue on reading logs was resolved with explicit UTF-8; saved logs were intact.

## 8. Not done, limitations and technical debt

Synthetic/local only;no production/RBAC/scale/CVE/native Linux/live Cloudflare evidence. Independent fresh tabs without opener are verified; duplicated/opener session cloning is not claimed. Existing storage-denial/clearing/fragment16384 limits remain. Healthy sibling main rows in invalid filtered views are retained in DOM/state but hidden while filtered panel is active; no claim that all panels are simultaneously visible. DONE applies only to the assigned synthetic/local criteria. Actual upload outcome and exact immutable fallback recorded in task submission/checkpoint;quota boundary honored.

## 9. Blockers and decisions required

No new missing-input/spec/security/production decision. Browser review interruption resolved after reset. Q-01..Q-05 untouched. Separate QA approval required before merge;Dev does not merge. Lead19:34 reaffirms original assignment and authorizes immutable GitHub fallback if actual RESULT upload fails.

## 10. Next step and self-check

Push existing feature branch/update PR1;verify live current-headCI. Attempt RESULT/evidence upload and publish exactly one [DEV][SUBMISSION] per task with honest outcome and exact fallback if needed. Verify published UI/checkpoint;continue valid Lead/QA work without duplicates.
