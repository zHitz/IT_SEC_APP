## 1. Summary

Site picker name-desc/search Site/page2, Site-filtered Hosts hostname-desc/search host-/page2, Host11 package version-desc/search package/page2 and ports pid-desc/search synthetic/page2 coexist in one fragment. Detail returns to Site Hosts; picker return and same-Site reopen retain Host page2. Package and port page2 each contain6 rows. Native AC-1/3/4 remain unverified; accepted actual600010ms outage retained, not rerun. Final83tests pass,0fail;lint94;schema unchanged;buildPASS. No production, collector, API contract or schema change. QA approval remains required before merge.

## 2. Acceptance criteria







Original and V4–V6/QA rows retain their previously accepted evidence boundaries. V7 below supersedes the old full-reload limitation.

## 3. Work completed

Site picker name-desc/search Site/page2, Site-filtered Hosts hostname-desc/search host-/page2, Host11 package version-desc/search package/page2 and ports pid-desc/search synthetic/page2 coexist in one fragment. Detail returns to Site Hosts; picker return and same-Site reopen retain Host page2. Package and port page2 each contain6 rows. Native AC-1/3/4 remain unverified; accepted actual600010ms outage retained, not rerun. Reused accepted GET inventory endpoints and existing Atlas UI controls/styles. Implemented explicit origin bookmarks so nested return does not fall into a different list. Verified actual built-in browser direct/reload/Back/Forward and invalid-state screenshots. Published [DEV][START] on the exact assigned task; no status change.

## 4. Files changed

| File | Specific change |
|---|---|
| frontend/src/host-navigation.mjs | Serialize explicit Site origin and inactive Site bookmark; restore selected Site Host list on detail Back; site_resume retains Host page through picker reopen. |
| frontend/src/site-hosts.mjs | Make Host names open exact Host detail; add Back to Site picker; preserve same-Site Host search/sort/page. |
| frontend/src/domain-navigation.mjs | Serialize Flagged origin and saved Flagged list alongside Domain/detail context; route detail Back to correct origin. |
| frontend/src/flagged-domains.mjs | Add explicit Open Domain detail buttons on existing stored-flag owner cards. |
| frontend/test/combined-origin-navigation.test.mjs | Two actual HTTP/PostgreSQL READ ONLY integration regressions cover combined journeys, fresh DOM, native-history fixture, all returns/reopens and six invalid cases per task. |
| scripts/inventory-ui-lab.mjs | Add isolated siteJourneyFixtures / --site-journey option assigning24 synthetic hosts to Sample Site so Host11 occurs on descending page2; old fixtures unchanged. |
| Docs/HOST-INVENTORY-UI.md | Document Site origin, return/reopen behavior, fixture option and reproduction command. |
| Docs/DOMAIN-INVENTORY-UI.md | Document dual-origin parameters and Domain/Flagged return semantics. |
| Docs/evidence/S0-003/verification-v27.json | Record actual check results, fixture rows, browser checks, failures and limits. |
| Docs/evidence/S0-003/{test,lint,build}-v27.txt | Actual final full-suite83pass,lint94/schema22+2/114FK and build output. |
| Docs/evidence/S0-003/host-combined-{reload,history,invalid}-v27.png | Three actual built-in browser screenshots; synthetic data only. |
| Docs/RESULT-TASK-S0-003.md | Canonical v27 report; preserve original and previous version AC evidence, add separate V27-1..4 rows. |

## 5. Run and verify

From repository root: `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`.
Focused: `node --test --test-concurrency=1 frontend/test/combined-origin-navigation.test.mjs`.
Host lab: `node scripts/inventory-ui-lab.mjs --host-detail --sites --site-journey`; Domain lab: `node scripts/inventory-ui-lab.mjs --detail-dns --flagged`. For combined browser verification both sets of flags can be used in one lab. Open the returned loopback origin at /inventory/hosts or /inventory/domains and use the full fragment in combined-origin-navigation.test.mjs. Setup writes synthetic fixtures before the regression begins READ ONLY; runtime API calls are GET/SELECT only.

## 6. Tests and actual results

Final full suite83/83 passed,0failed;lint94modules;schema22entities+2junctions/114nativeFK unchanged;buildPASS. Both targeted tests use actual local HTTP and PostgreSQL17.5 WASM with BEGIN READ ONLY after setup. Output markers HOST_JOURNEY_V27_PROOF and DOMAIN_JOURNEY_V27_PROOF each record six invalid cases and successful reload/history/return/reopen. Actual built-in browser verified Host11 six package/six port rows, Site Host page2/3 and picker page2/2; Sample04 DNS page2/2 five rows, record192.0.2.99, Flagged page2/2 and main Domain page2/2. Screenshots were captured after settled visible state and inspected. Evidence in Docs/evidence/S0-003; Cloudflare requests0.

## 7. Issues and implementation decisions

Initial targeted Host assertion used an old Site fixture count, then showed Host11 was absent from that descending second page. Added a separate synthetic Site-journey fixture; did not alter existing fixtures or schema. Strengthened the test for picker return and same-Site reopen; fixed page reset using site_resume. Explicit origin survives nested detail changes while a main-list selection keeps its main origin. Browser hash-only navigation initially retained an older loaded module; reloaded the local page and verified final behavior. A broad exact-text selector matched hidden rows; scoped it to the actual DNS record panel. Python cp1258 console could not print the test checkmark after tests exited0; logs were intact, lint/build then completed. Final full checks rerun after the last source change. All these are resolved technical/lab details, not blockers.

## 8. Not done, limitations and technical debt

Synthetic/local only; no production authentication/RBAC/scale/native Linux/live Cloudflare/CVE evidence. Versions sort lexically. Existing bounded Site identity lookup and stored-flag owner guard limits remain; no scale claim. Native AC-1/3/4 unverified; accepted actual600010ms outage retained, not rerun; overall PARTIAL. ClickUp quota boundary honored; if browser file upload fails, use the Lead-authorized immutable GitHub report-commit fallback, report zero new attachments honestly.

## 9. Blockers and decisions required

No new missing-input/spec/security/production decision or hard blocker. Q-01..Q-05 untouched. Separate QA approval is required before merge; Dev does not merge. ClickUp upload outcome and submission fingerprints are recorded in the final task comment and checkpoint.

## 10. Next step and self-check

Push the existing feature branch and update existing PR1. Verify current-head CI live, attempt actual RESULT upload, and publish exactly one [DEV][SUBMISSION] per assigned task using exact immutable fallback if needed. Verify UI and checkpoint; continue valid Lead/QA work without duplicate submission.

- [x] Exact ten numbered sections and separate original/historical/current AC rows.
- [x] Exact source/time, specific files, reproduction commands and actual output.
- [x] Six invalid cases per task, three actual screenshots, failures/fixes and limits stated.
- [x] Schema/collector/API/production boundaries retained; no self-ACCEPT/status change/merge.
