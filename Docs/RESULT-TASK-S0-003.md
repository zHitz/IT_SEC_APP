## 1. Summary

PARTIAL in declared scope. Simultaneous picker name-desc/searchSite/page2 and selectedSite Host hostname-desc/searchhost-/page2 survive direct/reload/history and both parent returns. Changing one sort retains the other list context. Four invalid picker and four invalid host cases clear only their own list. NativeAC1/3/4 remain unverified;accepted600010msoutage retained/notrerun. Full79/79tests,0fail;lint93;schema22+2/114FK unchanged;buildPASS.

## 2. Acceptance criteria







Original and V4–V6/QA rows retain their previously accepted evidence boundaries. V7 below supersedes the old full-reload limitation.

| ID | Criterion | Result / actual evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | Three native Linux hosts with OS/packages | Native portion unverified; accepted v2 simulator evidence retained; v4 adds no native claim. |
| AC-2 | Actual ten-minute outage/recovery without loss | Previously accepted actual 600010 ms/60 batches/69 executions/pending0 retained in verification.json; not rerun. Fast regression remains green. |
| AC-3 | Native host changes limited to agent | Native portion unverified; v3 readiness/runbook retained, accepted. |
| AC-4 | Five-step native install works | Native portion unverified; accepted fresh simulator evidence and future native runbook retained. |
| AC-5 | Correct entity/upsert/timestamps | Accepted v2 evidence and full-suite regression pass; v4 reads existing schema only. |
| AC-6 | SELECT-only source and safe payload | Accepted source/privacy regression passes; v4 fixed field projections exclude raw payload and sensitive fields. |

## 3. Work completed

Implemented live Lead15:41 v25 assignment. Simultaneous picker name-desc/searchSite/page2 and selectedSite Host hostname-desc/searchhost-/page2 survive direct/reload/history and both parent returns. Changing one sort retains the other list context. Four invalid picker and four invalid host cases clear only their own list. NativeAC1/3/4 remain unverified;accepted600010msoutage retained/notrerun.

## 5. Run and verify

Repository root:`npm ci`;`npm test`;`npm run lint`;`npm run build`. Focused:`node --test frontend/test/site-navigation.test.mjs frontend/test/flagged-child-navigation.test.mjs`. Browserlabs:`node scripts/inventory-ui-lab.mjs --sites` (Host path) and `node scripts/inventory-ui-lab.mjs --flagged-child` (Domain path); append exact v25 fragment from corresponding UI guide.

## 6. Tests and actual results

79 tests passed;zero failures. Lint93modules;schema22entities+2junctions/114nativeFK unchanged;buildPASS. Actual local HTTP/PostgreSQL tests execute READ ONLY after seed setup. Complete routes, changing each sort, parent/chain returns, freshDOM reload and history tested. Built-in browser actual reload and native history verified after settled-state checks; three viewport screenshots per task. Evidence:`Docs/evidence/S0-003/verification-v25.json`,test-v25.txt,lint-v25.txt,build-v25.txt and combined/chain reload/history/invalid screenshots.

## 7. Issues and implementation decisions

No v25 test failures. Split list validation so invalid sort does not invalidate an entire container. Picker and Host controls retain independent search/sort/page; only the changed side resets its own page. Flagged child Back removes child keys and preserves flagged list keys. On invalid flagged-list sort, selected exact owner is fetched and checked against the existing stored-flag inventory predicate; only that child is retained, invalid sibling list cards are suppressed. Guard checks up to100 literal-name candidates; seed scope verified, no large-scale claim. Only GET inventory reads;no schema/entity/API/tagalgorithm/collector changes. Known MCPquota retry boundary honored; attempted browser upload/fallback outcome recorded honestly in task comment/checkpoint.

## 8. Not done, limitations and technical debt

Synthetic local only;no production auth/RBAC/scale/CVE/nativeLinux/liveCloudflare/credential evidence. Viewport screenshots. Inventory changes can alter pagination between reads. Original nativeAC1/3/4 remainunverified;acceptedactual600010msoutage retained,notrerun;overallPARTIAL.

## 9. Blockers and decisions required

No new missing input/spec/security/production decision or hard blocker. Q01..Q05 untouched. ClickUp MCPquota remains exhausted until recorded retry boundary; authorized browser/immutable GitHubfallback available. QA approval required before merge;Dev does not merge.

## 10. Next step and self-check
